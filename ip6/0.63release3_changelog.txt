JOYSTICK 2P side was supported
The file with the extension P6 was also displayed in the file open dialog
When returning from the full screen to the normal window,
I changed the state back to the original state
I made it possible to set colors in the pseudo TV mode on SCREEN 4
Supported FDD only when mk II ROM is used (however temporary support)
