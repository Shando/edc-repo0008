  isn't driven by PIC, role of PIC still unknown [David Haywood]

- add basic hookups of internal peripherals to the V53, made it an actual
  CPU type derived from the V33.  Most of these have come from the PC emulation
  * DMA Controller (subset of uPD71071/uPD71037), clone of 8237A
  * Serial Controller (modified uPD71051), clone of i8251
  * Interrupt Controller (uPD71059 equivalent), clone of PIC8259
  * Timer Unit (identical to uPD71054), clone of pit8253
  [David Haywood]

- hooked up ROM banking to Hyper Neogeo 64 Sound CPU, this, along with the
  above V53 peripherals improves the code flow on the CPU significantly,
  although the interrupt hookups, communication, and sound generation are still
  not yet understood [David Haywood]

- Improved some textures (billboards) in Xtreme Rally (Hyper Neogeo 64)
 * some road parts now look worse however, so still needs work, might be
