0.83: International users rejoice, a sticky setting exists that allows the
selection of alternate character sets.  This might not work correctly.  Do
not delete "dapple.chr" if you change the settings.  Remember, Dapple does
get characters from DOS, so KEYB will affect the layout of the keyboard as
Dapple sees it.  Key mapping for High ASCII characters is based on CP 437,
and depends on the Apple charset selected.  Also... //e screen paging bugs
have been partially fixed.  Still no Page 2 in //e mode.
