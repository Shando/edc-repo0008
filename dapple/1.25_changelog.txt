1.25:  From outside: some  internal changes to improve  the 80-column text
support  (although  right  now  it  is  fudged,  it  is  still  relatively
readable, and if  you  really want, you can run  AppleWorks 2.x with  it).
Also, a  little  tweak to cgafnt2h to  make a  cleaner font.h (changes the
type from char to unsigned char).
