1.11:  Replaced the #defines for the CPU type with an enum.  Added code to
disassemble for whatever processor is currently selected CPU.  Changed the
debugger to support more Apple-like commands.  Fixed a bug: the setting of
"Manipulate Caps Lock" was reversed.  Forgot to remove "Experimental" from
the UI; this has been fixed.  Fixed another bug introduced while trying to
excise the last vestiges of Marat code in the debugger - memory dumps were
displaying the same 16 bytes over and over.  Added an option to disable F8
(it was annoying me!)
