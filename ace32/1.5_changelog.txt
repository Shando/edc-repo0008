1.5 on 12 Feb-2010
        Version 1.4 Stubbed with WDOSX Extender WDX097B2
        to make ACE32 work under Windows XP.
        ace32.exe renamed ace32xp.exe to show it will run under windows XP.
        A new Zip file created call Ace32XP[1.5) with the new stubbed version.
        
        Please note the 'splash screen' has not been changed so it will
        tell you its version 1.4.
