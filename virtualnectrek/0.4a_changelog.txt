	Updated capabilities with features recently updated in my other emulators:
	Full Screen mode can now access the menus. Right click on the full screen to toggle menus.
	The sound buffers will attempt to resynch themselves when no sound has been playing for a while (a half-second or so). This is detected by the speaker clicker not being written to and by the three AY chip volumes being set to 0.
	The POV hat can be used as the joystick directionals in a modern USB joypad.
	Util/Load Binary -- This is useful for assembly language program development.
	Util/Screenshot (F11)  -- puts the screenshots into the screenshots directory.  Beware, the names wrap after 9999.
	Util/Full Screen mode (F12 to toggle)
	Util/Paste -- this Quicktypes text that was on the text clipboard, i.e. Copy from Notepad and Paste onto the emulator.
	Some file access routines are smarter about remembering which file you were using last.  It takes getting used to, but it really is better than before.  Really.
	The emulator should no longer crash when you have Configure/System Timing>Speed up when accessing files checked.
	Soft Reset is now F9 on the keyboard.
	Hard Reset is now Shift F9 on the keyboard.
